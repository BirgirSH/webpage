                            <h2>Preparations</h2>
                            <p>As usually, before starting work on the project I watched a <a href="https://vimeopro.com/academany/fab-2019/video/318844907">lecture</a> to get a sense of purpose for doing it. The lecture, <i>3D Scanning and Printing</i>, was probably the most interesting I've watched so far and provided some great insight into the capabilities, limitations and prospects of 3D printing as well as introducing 3D scanning briefly. I noted some interesting information from the lecture here below.</p>
                            
                            <p>1. <b>Additive vs subtractive</b>: 3D printing is an additive manufacturing method whereas CNC milling is a subtractive manufacturing method.</p>
                            <p>3. <b>Geometrical complexity</b>: Objects made with additive manufacturing methods offer much more geometrical complexity than otherwise.</p>
                            <p>4. <b>Resolution and Material constraints<b>: Additive manufacturing methods are far from perfect as casting offers a higher resolution and they are limited to few materials.</p>
                            <p>5. Slow manufacturing</p>
                            <p>6. Supports are sometimes needed to keep the object stable during printing.</p>
                            <p>7. Design rules: minimum wall thickness, thermal properties of the material can affect tolerances, printing processes are orientation dependant.</p>
                            <p>8. Various 3D printing processes offer different pros and cons.</p>
                            <p>9. Large-scale concrete printing is an exciting and growing industrial solution.</p>
                            <p>10. Mechanical properties of 3D printed objects tend to suffer unless with very expensive selective laser sintering machines.</p>
                            <p>11. He demonstrated affordable machines. I've wondered if fillaments are affected by the environment and it was interesting to see that machines from sindoh use cartridges in a  closed environment.</p>
                            <p>12. STL files are the most common. List of triangles. Can be big. Units or material properties are not part of the format.</p>
                            <p>13. Methods to 3D scan objects are more widespread than I thought.</p>
                            <p>14. Intensive computation required for photogrammetry.</p>
