                            <h2>Preparations</h2>
                            
                            <p>When beginning new projects I usually watch an entire lecture to better understand the material at hand, but this time a good portion of the prerecorded lecture from Fab Academy was of limited use. The random review conducted lasted almost the entire lecture so I skipped though alot of it and instead looked for other resources. The lecture in question can be found <a href="https://vimeopro.com/academany/fab-2019/video/326957374">here</a>.</p>
                            <p>In this project a double negative will be modelled for the <i>Spiral Shell</i> in the Final Project. A step-by-step guide on how the spiral shell was modelled can be found in the final project homepage environment <a href="https://birgirsh.github.io/webpage/project7.html">(link)</a>. After the negatives are created, a milling simulation will be performed.</p>
                            <p>To better understand the concept of double negatives or two-part molds I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKZx9eHEL6o">this</a> excellent video on the subject. Thinking that this project would be a piece of cake I zealously embarked on a CAD journey that, unbeknownst to me at the time, would be a lengthy and difficult process.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Modelling negatives</h2>
                            
                            <p>I started with creating an offset plane a short distance from the shell.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind1.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>Onto that plane I drew a simple square that encapsules the entire body.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind2.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>The square was then extruded so that the shell disappeared completely, creating a new intersecting body.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind3.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>Under <i>modify</i> the <b>combine</b> modification was opened, the box selected as the <b>target body</b> and the shell as the <b>tool body</b>, and its operation set to <b>cut</b>. Although the picture shows otherwis, "new component" was actually left unchecked but "keep tools" checked.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind4.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>It was here that I realised that things would not be so simple. Simply splitting this box in two would not result in a nice two-part mold that could be used for casting. After thinking the problem though for a while the solution was very clear. I drew a new sketch similar to the spiral sketch but going through the circles' centers instead of their endpoints. This would be used as rails for the imminent loft feature.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind5.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>The sketch was lofted thusly.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind8.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>After repeating the loft feature for all the circles this was the result.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind9.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>The resulting body is going to be used as a cutting tool for the box. Like in the first attempt, an offset plane was defined, a square was drawn and it then extruded.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind10.png" style="width:100%">                        
                            
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind11.png" style="width:100%">
                           
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind12.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>The combine tool was used just as before.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind13.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>The top of the box needed to be slightly cut.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind14.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>The result is the bottom part of the two-part mold.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind15.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>The top part was simply made by using the loft feature like before but on the inner diameter circles. The result was this.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind16.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>A section view of this two-part mold better showcases how the resin will simply fill the empty space once directly poured on the mold.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind17.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>The mold is not quite ready yet, the top piece in its current form would simply fall down rendering the mold useless. A simple solution for this is a bracket (new body) that would simply be glued to the top piece, providing stability.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind18.png" style="width:100%">

                            <p>A small rectangular hole was cut in the bottom piece so that the bracket can snap into it and stabilize the top piece.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind20.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>The entire two-part mold assembly looks like this.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind21.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>Using the <b>mirror</b> feature a two-part mold for the other side of the shell was made in a heartbeat.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/mind22.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>The next step was to install <b>VCarve</b> and create appropriate toolpaths for the milling of the molds. I got the free trial version from VCarve's <a href="https://www.vectric.com/products/vcarve-pro">homepage</a>. Opening the program, I clicked <i>File</i> and then <i>new</i>. I watched a video on two-sided milling made by Fablab Akureyri <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/search-result/caas/screencast/Main/Details/0befd97e-c49a-4cba-9f04-53463b10d246.html">here</a> to better understand the user interface.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/vcarve1.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>The bottom piece of the mold only requires that the <i>job type</i> is set to <b>single sided</b> due to its geometry. The dimensions for the <i>job size</i> were then adjusted to accommodate the entire bottom piece. The resolution was increased a bit and the appearance changed from wood to blue plastic (the material would be wax in reality).</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/vcarve1.2.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>On the bottom of the gui is a <i>model</i> tab which I selected and then imported the stl. file of the bottom mold piece. After adjusting some of the parameters the model was correctly defined within the job size constraints.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/vcarve2.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>Pressing "ok" revealed the model.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/vcarve3.png" style="width:100%">

                            <p>Next on schedule was to define the <b>rough machining toolpath</b> that would perform the initial milling. I selected an end mill drill bit with a diameter of 6 mm and 2 flutes and adjusted the stepover to 75% as recommended in the video. The spindle speed was set to 12000 rpm and the feed rate to 5000 mm/min.</p>

                            <p>The <b>finish mahining toolpath</b> was then defined. Choosing a 3 mm ball nose drill bit with 2 flutes. The stepover rate was greatly reduced to 10% and the feed rate was reduced to 4000 mm/min.</p>
