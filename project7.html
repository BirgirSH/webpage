                            <h2>Goal</h2>
                            
                            <p>After extensive brainstorming my group decided that the final project would be to design and create a subwoofer inspired by Bowers and Wilkins' <i>Nautilus</i> design as introduced in project 1. It came as no surprise that many enthusiasts have done comparable projects before, for example <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Nautilus-Speakers/">Nickolae's</a> 3D printed, upside-down version from which we will be drawing heavy inspiration from.</p>
                            <p>Our version, however, will utilize <b>molding and casting</b> techniques to create the spiral shell housing. The bracket to hold the subwoofer will be cut from wood with a <b>CNC</b> machine similarly to Nickolae's project but will incorporate a <b>pressfit</b> design in some manner. Finally, the feet suports will be 3D printed and the whole assembly screwed into place with from-the-shelf screws.</p>
                                
                            <h2>Concept</h2>
                            
                            <p>To begin with, I made a couple of simple sketches that, although far from accurate and might not represent the final product, will lay the necessary conceptual groundwork for the CAD design.</p>
                            
                             <img src="Images/3Dview.jpeg" style="width:100%">
                             <img src="Images/sidefront.jpeg" style="width:100%">
                             <img src="Images/assembly.jpeg" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <h2>CAD Modelling</h2>
                            
                            <p>The first part that was modelled was the bracket as it is easier to parameterize in case we would decide to choose another subwoofer.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/bracket.JPG" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>Then I started to model the most complex component of this design, the spiral shell. I began with inserting a picture of a nautilus speaker into my workspace.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/pic1.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>Using the picture as a reference, I created a sketch and followed the geometry closely using the <b>spline</b> tool.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/pic2.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>After a short while I had completed the spiral profile.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/pic3.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>As expected, the scale of the sketch was not correct. Using the <b>measure</b> tool I measured the length of the straight line (the diameter around the speaker) and then used the <b>scale</b> feature on the entire sketch so that the straight line would have a length of 127 mm (5 in).</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/pic5.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>After fixing the scale I created a new sketch on the same plane as the spiral profile and drew a 2-point circle that would serve as the "beginning" of the spiral. A line was also drawn in the midle of the circle.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/pic6.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>Using the <b>revolve</b> feature on half of the circle area from the previous sketch, I created a new body. Only a 90° angle was chosen as it is easier to see the interior of the spiral shell if it is not closed.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/pic7.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>Similarly, the "end" of the spiral shell was created that would finally be cut.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/pic8.png" style="width:100%">
                            <img src="Images/pic9.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>Using the <b>loft</b> feature on these two half-circle surfaces and selecting the spiral sketch as the rails unfortunately resulted in an error message that advised to do this in multiple steps. I then proceded to create 20 new planes to draw more circles onto.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/pic10.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <img src="Images/pic11.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>Beginning with drawing one circle (maybe I should have begun with creating one plane also) I again tried the loft feature on these two very close sketches, again selecting the spiral sketch as the rails.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/pic12.png" style="width:100%">
                            
                            <p>The result was a partial success. The loft feature was successfully created but it dit not follow the rails correctly.</p>
                            
                            <img src="Images/pic13.png" style="width:100%">
                                                               
                            <p>After a couple very strenuous hours of trying to make this work and failing, I decided to start a new design. This time I would begin with defining a parameter, <i>DriverDiameter</i>, and setting its inital value as 127mm.</p>
