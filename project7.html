                            <h2>Goal</h2>
                            
                            <p>After extensive brainstorming my group decided that the final project would be to design and create a subwoofer inspired by Bowers and Wilkins' <i>Nautilus</i> design as introduced in project 1. It came as no surprise that many enthusiasts have done comparable projects before, for example <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Nautilus-Speakers/">Nickolae's</a> 3D printed, upside-down version from which we will be drawing heavy inspiration from.</p>
                            <p>Our version, however, will utilize <b>molding and casting</b> techniques to create the spiral shell housing. The bracket to hold the subwoofer will be cut from wood with a CNC machine similarly to Nickolae's project but will incorporate a pressfit design in some manner. Finally, the feet suports will be 3D printed and the whole assembly screwed into place with from-the-shelf screws.</p>
                                
                            <h2>Concept</h2>
                            
                            <p>To begin with, I made a couple of simple sketches that, although far from accurate and might not represent the final product, will lay the necessary conceptual groundwork for the CAD design.</p>

                            <h2>CAD Modelling</h2>
                            
                            <p>The first part that was modelled was the bracket as it is easier to parameterize in case we would decide to choose another subwoofer.</p>
